# Aora: A React Native App
An example of my experience creating a video sharing app using React Native. 

### Technologies Used
- React Native
- NativeWind
- Appwrite.io

### Run the Program
To run the Aora program on your local device:
1. Clone the github repo to your IDE (I personally use VSCode)
2. Download Expo Go on your phone
3. In the terminal, run `npx expo start`
4. Scan the QR code that is generated

### Usage Instructions
Once you have the application running on your local device, signup up for an account.
After your account is created, you will be able to add content for everyone to see (please only post appropriate content)
